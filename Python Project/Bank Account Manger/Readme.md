# Bank Account Manager Project

## Overview
In these Preject I created  Bank Account Manager project is a Python-based application for managing various types of bank accounts, including Checking, Savings, and Business accounts. It allows users to perform common banking transactions, such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking account balances, in an ATM-style program.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several classes:

1. **Account Class (Abstract)**: Serves as the base abstract class for all account types. It defines common methods like `deposit` and `withdraw`.

2. **CheckingAccount Class**: Represents a checking account with a specific fee for withdrawals and allows deposit and withdrawal operations.

3. **SavingsAccount Class**: Represents a savings account with an interest rate. It supports deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.

4. **BusinessAccount Class**: Represents a business account with transaction fees and a monthly maintenance fee. It allows deposit, withdrawal, and fee deduction.

## Code Implementation
The project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- Effective use of inheritance to create specialized account types.
- Proper encapsulation with attributes and methods.
- Error handling to prevent overdrawing accounts.
- Interactive user input and clear prompts for a seamless user experience.

## Future Enhancements
While the Bank Account Manager project is functional, there is potential for further improvements:

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure access to accounts.
- **Transaction History**: Add a transaction history feature for account statements.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.

## Conclusion
The Bank Account Manager project demonstrates effective use of Python's object-oriented features for managing different types of bank accounts. It can serve as a foundation for building more sophisticated banking applications.
